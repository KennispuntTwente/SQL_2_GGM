* Cross-dialect guarding
Cross-dialect query portability in staging_to_silver:
Query modules contain dialect-specific constructs (e.g., Postgres’ timezone() in staging_to_silver/queries/BeschikteVoorziening.py:1), while staging_to_silver/main.py:1 unconditionally loads and executes all queries. Running these against MSSQL/MySQL will fail.
Recommendation:
Make builder functions dialect-aware (branch in the builder by engine.dialect.name) and emit equivalent constructs per dialect, or
Add a filtering mechanism (configurable allowlist/denylist) to only execute queries compatible with the current backend, and document per-query backend support in staging_to_silver/README.md:1.
Postgres-only statement in a generic path:
staging_to_silver/main.py:1 always executes SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED, which is PostgreSQL-specific. This will break on other DBs.
Recommendation: Guard with if engine.dialect.name == 'postgresql' before executing.
Upsert mode:
Uses .on_conflict_do_update on an Insert, which is PostgreSQL-only. The file comments acknowledge this, but the dispatcher (write_modes) doesn’t guard by engine.dialect.name.
Recommendation: Add a dialect guard for upsert or document that upsert mode is PG-only and validate before use to give a clear error message.
Add a test (can be unit-scoped) that staging_to_silver/main.py:1 guards PG-only features and dialect-specific query execution. Even a smoke test with a dummy engine/dialect that asserts guard logic would catch the unconditional SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED.

* Packages/dependencies
Potentially unnecessary or suspect deps:
mssql>=1.0.1 seems questionable (commonly pyodbc or pymssql are used; you already have pyodbc).
pandas is declared but not used; consider removing to reduce image size and dependency footprint.
Verify if sqlparse is used; remove if not needed.
Add [build-system] (e.g., requires=["setuptools>=...","wheel"], build-backend="setuptools.build_meta").
Move pytest and any dev-only tooling into a dev/extra group (uv supports this).
Remove unused deps or clearly justify them.
Metadata gaps: description, readme, authors, license (although LICENSE.md exists), and classifiers.
Fill metadata for better distribution/consumption.

* Direct transfer
Might add a small retry/backoff for transient DB issues during large transfers.

* staging_to_silver/README.md:1 is succinct; add:
Clarify dialect support per query module (or a matrix).
Explain write_modes and how to configure/override them.

* Remove duplicate log printing
